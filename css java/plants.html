            Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes, forming the kingdom Plantae. Many are multicellular. Historically, the plant kingdom <br> encompassed all living things that were not animals, and included algae and fungi.

            Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight, using chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria.<br> Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis using the pigment chlorophyll, which gives them their green colour

            There are about 380,000 known species of plants, of which the majority, some 260,000, produce seeds. Green plants provide a substantial<br> proportion of the world's molecular oxygen and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems.
